# Risk Survey - Node & Express
Academic survey comparing demographic info, risk attitudes, and behavior in a 2-round coin flip game. Variable in playGame.js can be set to specify if the game is being played for extra credit points or cash.

Game results and demographic info will be saved to a db by the server handling the game itself. Collecting the user's name info has to be done by a different server and db to keep the information separate (IRB requirement).  The code for that server will be linked to this project once it's complete.
